# LIST OF TOPICS - TARGET
1. How to communicate between Modbus Slave and Modbus Pool in the **same local host** (Depending on your system: Windows, Linux, MAC)
2. How to communicate between Modbus Slave and Modbus Pool in the **different machines** (1: Local host - 2: Virtual Machine)
3. How to build a **website** that can communicate with a **Modbus Slave** (which is located on your local host)
4. How to communicate between **SCADA on iFIX** and **Modbus Poll** (Modbus Slave --> Modbus Poll --> SCADA --> HMI)
5. How to communicate between **PLC SIEMENS** to **Modbus Poll** on simulation mode
6. How to communicate between **ESP32** and **Modbus Poll** on **IoT Gateway**

# ERRORS - SOLUTION
1. If you cannot connect the Modbus Poll and Modbus Slave using TCP/IP protocol
   1. Check the Windows Defender Firewall - Turn off the firewall
   2. Check if there is any client that connects on the same PORT or IP Address
